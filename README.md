=========

my first angular project


I did the Codeschool course "Shaping up with Angular.js" and learned about: 

* Angular is a client-side Javascript framework for adding interactivity to HTML

* Directives: HTML annotations that trigger Javascript behaviors
* Modules: Where our application components live
* Controllers: Where we add application behavior
* Expressions: How values get displayed within the page


Built-in Directives:
* ng-app: to attach the application model to the page
* ng-controller: to attach a controller function to the page
* ng-show / ng-hide: display / hide a section based on an expression
* ng-repeat: to repeat a section for each item in an array
* ng-src: for images
* ng-click, ng-class
* ng-model: binds the form element value to the property

* built-in attributes e.g. form.$valid
